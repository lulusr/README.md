## Independent Study Log
### Day1
Through reading the reading list and briefing, I have a new understanding of creative-computing.
#### What is Creative Computing?
”Creative Computing is an exciting mix of computing and creative practice set in the context.Including code, build apps, 
craft digital experiences, explore machine intelligence and more. People will acquire a contemporary set of applied computing skills covering the dominant 
coding languages and workflows that support innovation in the digital technology sector and creative practice. Building on these skills, 
and through creative practice, people will also develop their ability to innovate. “_

Open source is also a new topic in this project.It refers to things that are planned to be publicly accessible, so people can modify and share them. 
Now it has evolved into a concept: including open source projects, products, or spontaneously advocating and welcoming open changes, collaborative participation, 
rapid prototyping, openness and transparency, and the principles of community-oriented development.

### Day2

Browsing the Arduino tutorial on the reading list, I found that we only need to have knowledge of physics and electricity in junior high school. 
But the difference is that we need to use code to complete the operation. Although the memory is not clear, I have gradually become aware and familiar with 
the operation steps after browsing the tutorials and operating ThinkerCAD.

### Day3

Complete my README File. By reading more learning videos and trying to practice many times, I have a more accurate and proficient understanding of this concept. 
Compared with me when I first came into contact with this subject on the first day, I gained knowledge about creative computing and the operation of Arduino.

## Reflection
The world is full of "source codes"-they guide and shape the way we think and act. We believe that this deep code (in whatever form) should be open, accessible,
and shared-so that people can participate in it and make it better. At the same time, the essence of science is innovation, and innovation is the source of power 
for the development of science and technology. The development of human society is first of all the advancement of people's ideology. The improvement of people's 
understanding of nature will bring about new science and technology, and there will be new social productive forces. With the improvement of people's understanding 
of society, new social thoughts and social systems will emerge, and social thoughts and social systems will be improved day by day.
